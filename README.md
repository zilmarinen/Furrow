# Introduction
Furrow is a macOS application designed to facilitate the visualisation and generation of texture atlases for tilesets modelled using [Dual Edge & Dual Corner](http://cr31.co.uk/stagecast/wang/blob.html) iterations of [Wang Tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_tile).

## Dependencies
